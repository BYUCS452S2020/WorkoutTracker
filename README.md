# WorkoutTracker

## Project Description

Web application for users to log/track their workouts

## Team

Looking for 1-2 others (excluding myself) to help develop frontend and backend architecture

## SQL

I think MySQL would be a good fit for tracking workouts and users

## NoSQL

Why not use document-based Mongo to store users and their workouts easily?

## Project Architecture

- A user's profile page would have options to view past workouts or start a new one
- Past experience using Vue.js but I am open to options if other people would like to do something else
- Using node.js for the backend should allow us to put more foucs into our databases and business logic instead of doing complicated server coding

## Business Plan

Potential ways to earn revenue:
- Since most users are interested in their health, we could contact health food/supplement suppliers and sell targeted adversiement space
- We could also sell ad space to fitness influencers who want to promote their social media accounts

## Legal Details

- If we wanted to sell our users' data (who wouldn't?), we would probably have to let them know in some long term-of-use agreement nobody ever reads
